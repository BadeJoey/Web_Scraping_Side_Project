A little side project of web scraping population data for the [Yelp Analyser](https://github.com/BadeJoey/Yelp_Analyser) project.

Here we scrap some Population Data of Vancouver from an anonymous website. 
- added a header to our requests to identify us
- set a waiting time between each request to not spam the site with requests
